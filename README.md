This repository contains both python scripts and notebooks used to gather and analyze the data used for our bachelor thesis. `analyzing.ipynb` generates figures and tables used in the thesis and is able to run and works from the `student-data.csv` file. 

The raw data with violations is not available because it contained student emails and they could not be perfectly anonymized. This means that `processing.ipynb` can not be executed as several files are missing. 

The python scrips themself (located under `scripts/`) does require access to student repositories and are therefor not executable aswell.
